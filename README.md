# Driver Disration at edge 

## Abstract 

Driver distraction is very common in today’s life where driver gets distracted over physically and
Emotionally, its very import to alert a distracted driver as a accident not only risk the driver’s life the
Collateral damage can cause multiple loss of lives and property, in this thesis we have proposed a
Efficient video distraction detection system that is fine tuned for edge gateways , the solution is
scalable & adaptable, the original video frames are processed using lightweight deep convolutional network,
Which serves as a multiclass classifier , we have also integrated the existing sensor based distraction
Detection and deployed in state of art IoT & edge deployment solution, we also validated our proposed
Camera placement strategy by the actual driving scenarios video and sensor simulation.
